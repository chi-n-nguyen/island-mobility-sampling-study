    Two-Stage Cluster Sampling Implementation for Island Mobility Study
    
    This class implements a statistically valid two-stage cluster sampling approach:
    
    STAGE 1 (Cluster Selection): Randomly select houses within each village
    STAGE 2 (Element Selection): Randomly select adults from within selected houses
    
    JUSTIFICATION FOR TWO-STAGE CLUSTER SAMPLING:
    1. EFFICIENCY: Reduces navigation time in web interface by targeting specific houses
    2. STATISTICAL VALIDITY: Maintains randomness while accounting for household clustering
    3. PRACTICAL: Works within constraints of limited interface navigation
    4. BIAS REDUCTION: Prevents systematic bias that could occur with convenience sampling
    5. REPRESENTATIVENESS: Ensures coverage across different household types and locations
    
    This approach is superior to simple random sampling in clustered populations because:
    - It accounts for natural clustering of individuals within households
    - More efficient data collection while maintaining statistical rigor
    - Reduces travel/navigation time between sampling units
